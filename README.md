# TinyZoo/GB

This repository houses a source port of the ZZT engine to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color platforms.

Downloads and usage documentation is available [on the Wiki of Weavers](https://zeta.asie.pl/wiki/doku.php?id=release:tinyzoo).

This project is not affiliated in any way with Nintendo. "Game Boy" and "Game Boy Color" are registered trademarks of Nintendo Co., Ltd.

## Licensing

TinyZoo/GB as a complete work is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

Some utility code is additionally made available under other licensing terms, such as the zlib license - check the specific files' copyright notices for more information.

Here are some clarifications provided by me to clarify the ways I expect TinyZoo/GB to be used in. **Note that only the official license text is legally binding - the clarifications below are not.**

  * As a ZZT world is a copyrightable work containing executable code, which the conversion process links statically with the game engine, publishing a world linked with TinyZoo/GB under the GPL implies that both the ZZT world and the resulting ROM images should be provided to recipients under the terms of the GPL.
    * This does not prevent you from dual-licensing them under different terms.
  * For the purposes of bundling ZZT worlds, "the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it" is considered to be the .ZZT file provided as input to the converter.
  * I do not see a problem with using TinyZoo/GB commercially; however, absent different licensing terms, users must be granted their necessary rights under the GPL.
  * I do not plan to pursue hobbyist, non-commercial usage of the publicly and freely available, unmodified TinyZoo/GB engine to distribute conversions of publicly and freely available, unmodified ZZT worlds.
    * Please do not exploit this statement. There can always be exceptions.

The terms are imposed primarily to protect the archival and preservation interests of the ZZT community - in particular, to prevent distribution of compiled ROM images without access to the underlying ZZT world source files.

If deemed necessary for your project, alternate licensing terms can be negotiated - please contact me for more information.
